----- About Hexxagon ------------------------------------------------------

The latest version of Hexxagon can be downloaded from: 
http://www.nesqi.se/hexxagon/

And you can reach me on this email:
hexxagon@nesqi.se



----- Compile / Install ---------------------------------------------------

Since it's hard enough to maintain the GTK front end I have discontinued 
the readline front end. If you want to play the game in text mode you will 
have to download the older version 3.3:

http://www.nesqi.se/hexxagon/download/hexxagon-0.3.3.tar.gz

To compile this source package you have to have these libraries installed:

gtk+ v2.4  - Which can be downloaded from http://www.gtk.org/download/

gtkmm v2.4 - This is a C++ wrapper for GTK+ 2. You can download gtkmm
             from http://www.gtkmm.org/.

If you are using debian you have to install the "-dev" packages as well
as the library packages.

If you have these libraries installed with there corresponding header files
the rest of the installation should be easy.

If the configure script can't find libgtkmm or libgtk+ you should try to add 
there locations to the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH separeted by
colons. You can read more about this in the pkg-config man page.

*** Install:

First run ./configure to prepare for compilation. This stage will tell you
if some libraries are missing.

Then run make to compile the program.

And finally install hexxagon by changing user to root with "su" or "sudo"
and run "make install".

This is it. Have fun!
